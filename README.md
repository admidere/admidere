I love working with software and systems, and I have a strong background in both low-level and high-level programming. I’m skilled in languages like C, Python, and JavaScript, which allows me to build solutions that range from hardware interactions to web applications.

Beyond just coding, I have experience managing databases, deploying applications, and working with DevOps practices. This has helped me understand how to create systems that are scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and enjoy tackling challenging problems with practical, effective solutions.
